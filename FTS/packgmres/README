GMRES Pack - by CERFACS - encapsulated in MaPHyS
================================================

This is an encapsulation of CERFACS' gmres solver into a static Library for 
the MaPHyS package. 

the goal of those procedure is to solve a linear algebra problem 

A x = b 

where A is the matrix, b the right hand side, x the unkown vector.
The method used here is the iterative GMRES method with some optimisations 
(see references below). 

Each file is specific to an arithmetic (simple/double real/complex)

SHIPPING
========

By reading the license (see below), it seems that the source code can be shipped
directly within MaPHyS' package for convenience reasons.

If this is an issue, please inform one of us to remove the contents :
